# MDKit

A toolkit for building integrated, feature rich markdown editor experiences.

Read [PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md) if you need to understand the product.

## Project mode

The project is currently in development and does not yet have production users. Data can be freely reset or removed, and schema changes can be made without requiring migrations or backward compatibility.

## Packages

- **`core`** - Browser-safe code: types, constants, schemas, pure functions. Safe to import anywhere including frontend.
- **`server`** - Node.js-only infrastructure: tRPC instance (`t`), logger, context types. Only import from backend.
- **`trpc`** - The tRPC router and procedures. Exports `createTrpcRouter` and `AppRouter` type.

See [modular-monolith.md](docs/modular-monolith.md) for the architecture philosophy.

## Running the Project

The project may well already be running in the background. Check and manage with:

```bash
zap ps
zap start someservice
zap logs someservice --no-follow
zap restart someservice
```

Check [zapper-usage.md](docs/zapper.md) for more details on running servers, restarting, viewing logs.

## Documentation

Read these before making changes:

- **[deployment-runbook.md](docs/deployment-runbook.md)** - Production URLs and secrets checklist
- **[terraform.md](docs/terraform.md)** - Technical reference for Terraform configuration
- **[style-guide.md](docs/style-guide.md)** - For significant code changes
- **[crud.md](docs/crud.md)** - For implementing simple CRUD patterns
- **[errors.md](docs/errors.md)** - For throwing and handling errors
- **[services.md](docs/services.md)** - For adding/removing services, frontends, databases, or updating infrastructure configuration
- **[trpc.md](docs/trpc.md)** - For doing frontend queries/mutations
- **[logging.md](docs/logging.md)** - For logging on backend (via tRPC context) and frontend
- **[event-schema.md](docs/event-schema.md)** - For sending/storing any kind of events: errors, logs, analytics, real time events follow this

## Tech stack

These should be used religiously:
- shadcn/ui
- Tailwind
- tRPC
- react-query or tRPC provided equivalent hooks

## UI

The frontend uses [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for UI components. Add new components with `npx shadcn@latest add <component>` from the `apps/frontend` directory.

Always use shadcn/ui where possible, including utilities like `cn` for conditional classnames.

## Agent Responsibility

You are expected to check logs, check which services are running, update env vars. The developer will do most of the manual testing. You can test for debugging purposes but if there's auth its probably better to leave it to the developer.

All the servers have hot reloading so you would not need to restart after every code change. If something big or low level changes; or it seems broken it can be worth restarting.

IMPORTANT: `.env.local` is for non-secrets, its ok for you to view and edit it! The regular `.env` is for secrets so leave that to the dev, just ask them to update secrets.

## Validation

For small changes, run `zap t check` to run linting and typechecking. For bigger system level changes run that and also `zap t build` to check that all the builds still succeed.
